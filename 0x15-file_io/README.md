This is a C programming project about working with files. There are three main tasks in this project.

The first task is to write a function called `read_textfile` that reads some text from a file and shows it on the screen. The function takes two inputs: the name of the file and the number of letters to read and show. If something goes wrong, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the number of letters it actually read and showed.

The second task is to write a function called `create_file` that makes a new file and writes some text in it. The function takes two inputs: the name of the file and the text to write. If there is no text to write, the function makes an empty file. If something goes wrong, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns 1 to show that everything worked.

The third task is to write a function called `append_text_to_file` that adds some text to the end of an existing file. The function takes two inputs: the name of the file and the text to add.

There is also a file called `main.h` that has some important information for these tasks.
