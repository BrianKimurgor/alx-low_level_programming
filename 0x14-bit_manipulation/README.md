# C Bit Manipulation

Bit manipulation is the act of changing the value of individual bits in a number. In C, you can use bitwise operators to manipulate bits.

## Bitwise Operators

There are several bitwise operators in C that you can use to manipulate bits:

- `&` (bitwise AND): This operator compares each bit of two numbers. If both bits are 1, the result is 1. Otherwise, the result is 0.
- `|` (bitwise OR): This operator compares each bit of two numbers. If either bit is 1, the result is 1. Otherwise, the result is 0.
- `^` (bitwise XOR): This operator compares each bit of two numbers. If the bits are different, the result is 1. Otherwise, the result is 0.
- `~` (bitwise NOT): This operator flips all the bits in a number. If a bit is 1, it becomes 0. If a bit is 0, it becomes 1.
- `<<` (left shift): This operator shifts all the bits in a number to the left by a certain number of positions.
- `>>` (right shift): This operator shifts all the bits in a number to the right by a certain number of positions.
