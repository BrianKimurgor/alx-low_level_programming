# C - Bit Manipulation

Bit manipulation is like playing with LEGO blocks, but instead of blocks, we use bits! Bits are tiny pieces of information that computers use to store and process data. They can only have two values: 0 or 1.

In C, we can use special tools called "bitwise operators" to build and change numbers using bits. For example, we can use the `&` operator to turn off certain bits in a number, or the `|` operator to turn them on. We can also use the `^` operator to flip bits from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.

With bit manipulation, we can do all sorts of cool things like compressing data to save space or making our programs run faster. It's like building a castle with LEGO blocks, but instead of blocks, we use bits!

So let's start playing with bits and see what amazing things we can build!
